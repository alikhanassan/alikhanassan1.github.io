            <h1>This page is about my home town Astana</h1>
            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astana">Astana </a> previously known as Akmolinsk, Tselinograd, Akmola, and most recently Nur-Sultan,[13] is the capital city of Kazakhstan.

The city lies on the banks of the <strong> Ishim River </strong>in the north-central part of Kazakhstan, within the Akmola Region, though administered as a city with special status separately from the rest of the region. A 2020 official estimate reported a population of 1,136,008 within the city limits, making it the second-largest city in the country, after Almaty, which had been the capital until 1997.[4] The city became the capital of Kazakhstan in 1997; since then it has grown and developed economically into one of the most modern cities in Central Asia.[14][15] In 2021, the government selected Astana as one of the 10 priority destinations for tourist development.[16]</p>
